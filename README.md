# Project Verona

An HTML Canvas experiment to build a multiplayer, area style, 3rd-person shooter. Development for this requires rare levels of motivation that I do not posses in the current season of life. This project will continue to take shape someday.

Sound effects and background music were pulled/combined from Splice loops and sounds.
